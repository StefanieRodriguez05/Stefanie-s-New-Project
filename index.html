                <h2> Effects of being hungry?</h2>
                  <p> People often do not notice the multitude of negative consequences caused                        by world hunger. For example, when students are hungry, they cannot focus                        in school. Consequentially, there is a drop in their performance and                            overall siccess i. school. 50% of children facing hunger need to repeat                        a grade. Additionally, hunger increases one's risk of chronic disease.                            According to the USDA, there is a strong connection between hunger and                          chronic diseases like high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes.                         In fact, 58% of the households that receive food from the Feeding America                       network have one member with high blood pressure. And 33% have a member                         with diabetes.</p>

                 <h2>Ways to help</h2>
                     <p> Poverty and Inequality are the root causes of world hunger. By                                  donating to charities that target food insecurity, one can help                                 provide those in need with the funds necessary to procure their daily                           sustenance. Additionally, planting community gardens in areas that                              suffer major food insecurity is another way to provide people with a                            healthy, free food source. Reducing food waste is another great way                             to stop food insecurity by outting the food that would have gone to                             waste to better use.</p>
